Where did I test this program:
=============================
So far I have tested this app on NERSC CORI-GPU cluster. I used both PrgEnv-llvm/9.0.0-git_20190220_cuda_10.1.168
and PrgEnv-intel/6.0.5 (to get the MKL LAPACK routines) for collecting data. It is running without any issue as of Aug 16, 2019.


How to compile:
==============
1. To compile this program run the following command:
    make gpu_v1

    this will give you lobpcg_libcsr_GPU_v1_openmp.x executable in exe folder.

How to run:
===========
1. To run this program do the following:
    srun -n 1 -c 10 ./exe/lobpcg_libcsr_GPU_v1_openmp.x <# of RHS vector> <path CSR formated to sparse matrix>

<# of RHS vector>: Lets vary this value like this - 4, 8, 12, 16 for each of the sparse matrix.
