cublasDgemm Mini App:
=====================
This mini app perform both X*Y and X'*Y operation on very big dense matrices on 
GPU. The source code perfroms both operation by tiling the tall skinny matrix and
using unified memory.

The X*Y operation is like this:
    Z = X*Y 
where the dimension of X is N*M and Y is M*P and the output is a N*P dense matrix.

The X'*Y operation is like this:
    Z = X'*Y
where the dimension of both X & Y are N*M and the output is a M*M dense matrix.

Where did we test this program?
===============================
We have tested this app on NERSC CORI-GPU and Summit dev cluster. We used both pgi/19.5
and cuda/10.0 modules for collecting data.

How to compile programs for XY operation:
========================================
1. Load the proper modules fist.
2. To compile xy tiled version run the following command:
        make xy
   this will give you executable named xy.x in exe folder.
2. To compile xy unified memory version run the following command:
        make xy_um
   this will give you executable named xy_um.x in exe folder.

How to run (XY opeartion):
=========================
Both tiled and unified memory version takes same parameters as input. To run any
version do the following:

srun -n 1 -c 10 --cpu-bind=cores ./exe/xy.x <N> <M> <P> <tile size>

<M/P> : Lets vary it like this- 16, 24, 32, 48, 64
<tile size> : Depends on your GPU memory. Make sure GPU memory is not overflown.



How to compile programs for XTY operation:
========================================
1. Load the proper modules fist.
2. To compile xty tiled version run the following command:
        make xty
   this will give you executable named xty.x in exe folder.
2. To compile xy unified memory version run the following command:
        make xty_um
   this will give you executable named xty_um.x in exe folder.

How to run (XTY opeartion):
=========================
Both tiled and unified memory version takes same parameters as input. To run any
version do the following:

srun -n 1 -c 10 --cpu-bind=cores ./exe/xty.x <N> <M> <tile size>

<M> : Lets vary it like this- 16, 24, 32, 48, 64
<tile size> : Depends on your GPU memory. Make sure GPU memory is not overflown.
