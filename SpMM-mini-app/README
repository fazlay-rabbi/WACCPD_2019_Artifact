SpMM Mini App
=============
This app performs tiled sparse matrix matrix multiplicaiton (SpMM) operation 
of the form: 
        Y = A * X
where A is n * n sparse matrix and X is a n * m dense matrix and the final
output Y is a n * p dense matrix.

This program reuires the sparse matrix A in CSR format and it essentially 
tile the big sparse matrix into block of rows and performs the SpMM operation
on each block. This program could be use to perfrom the tiled and unified memory 
(by using proper compilation flag) version of the SpMM operation.

Where did I test this program:
==============================
We have tested this app on NERSC CORI-GPU and Summit dev cluster. We used both pgi/19.5
and cuda/10.0 modules for collecting data on NERSC.

How to compile:
==============
1. Load the proper modules fist.
2. To compile tiled version run the following command:
        make spmm
   this will give you executable named spmm.x in exe folder.
2. To compile unified memory version run the following command:
        make spmm_um
   this will give you executable named spmm_um.x in exe folder.

How to run:
==========
Both tiled and unified memory version takes same parameters as input. To run any
version do the following:

srun -n 1 -c 10 --cpu-bind=cores ./exe/spmm.x <# of RHS vector> <tile size> <path to sparse mtx>

<# of RHS vector> : Lets vary it like this- 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64
<tile size> : Depends on your GPU memory. Make sure GPU memory is not overflown.
<path to sparse mtx> : provide the path to the CSR formated sparse matrix.
